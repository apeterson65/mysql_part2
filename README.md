The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp: Assignment 2

Files for section 14 instagram clone database
In section 14 we were creating the schema for the database adding some test data and verifying it loaded correctly.
I have 2 files for this:
  ig_clone.sql
  ig_queries.sql
  
In section 15 we took the layout from the instagram clone that we created and added data to from a download by the instructor. 
The purpose of this was to practice running quieres on the data. 
The initial file from Colt is ig_clone_data.sql. In this he drops the database created in the last excercise, recreates the database then loads in test data
I have the challenges from this section in the challenges.sql file.
